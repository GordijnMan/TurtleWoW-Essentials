## Usage

The point of this project is to automatically download updated versions of the selected AddOns. 
All AddOns are made specifically tailored to TurtleWoW.
Cloning 33 AddOns all at once is much faster than manually going through the [curated TurtleWoW AddOns list](https://turtle-wow.fandom.com/wiki/Addons).
However, it may still take some time. 
This is especially true for larger AddOns like [pfQuest](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest.git) that have entire multilingual databases.

* You will need [Git](https://git-scm.com/) to use this project.
* It utilizes all listed AddOns by pulling them as [submodules](./.gitmodules).
* Some AddOns will be pulled in nested directories, contain multiple plugins or have `-vanilla` directory postfixes.
    - [MikScrollingBattleText](https://github.com/AtheneGenesis/Vanilla_MikScrollingBattleText.git), [PowerAuras](https://github.com/laytya/PowerAuras-vanilla.git), [RestBar](https://github.com/Steelbash/RestBar.git) and [Spy](https://github.com/laytya/Spy-vanilla.git) all have nested directories that will not work unless you extract the AddOn files.
    - [aux-addon](https://github.com/shirsig/aux-addon-vanilla.git), [Cleanup](https://github.com/shirsig/Cleanup-vanilla.git) and [MinimapButtonFrame](https://github.com/laytya/MinimapButtonFrame-vanilla.git) have a `-vanilla` postfix in the directory name with must be removed in order to match it with the AddOn files.
* [WorldBuffSoundAlert](https://github.com/Bergador/WorldBuffSoundAlert.git), [RestBar](https://github.com/Steelbash/RestBar.git), [SpartanUI_SpinCam](https://github.com/Daribon/SpartanUI_SpinCam.git) and [MobsToLevel](https://github.com/idontbyte/MobsToLevel.git) are highly recommended at lower levels for new players.

Use:
* `git clone https://github.com/GordijnMan/TurtleWoW-Essentials.git` to clone this repository without the AddOns.
* `git submodule init` (inside the repository) to initialize the AddOn submodules.
* `git submodule update` (inside the repository) to update all AddOns to their latest versions.

Or, use:
* `git clone https://github.com/GordijnMan/TurtleWoW-Essentials.git --recurse-submodules` to download updated versions of all AddOns instantly.

## AddOns

**TOTAL: 34 (Â± 200MB)**

## Dependencies

* [AtlasLoot](https://github.com/Lexiebean/AtlasLoot.git) and [AtlasQuest](https://github.com/Nonameby/AtlasQuest.git) require [Atlas](https://github.com/Nonameby/Atlas.git).
  - Together, Atlas, AtlasLoot and AtlasQuest give the player access to loot tables for instances and dungeon quests.
  - These AddOns are more useful at later levels.
  - I recommended to disable them at first using [AddOnOrganizer](https://github.com/Monteo/AddOnOrganizer.git) to save AddOn memory.
* [aux_merchant_prices](https://github.com/shirsig/aux_merchant_prices.git) requires [aux-addon](https://github.com/shirsig/aux-addon-vanilla.git).
  - Never run a full scan, it is extremely time and resource consuming.
  - By the time you are finished scanning, the auction house will already look different.
* [Cleanup](https://github.com/shirsig/Cleanup-vanilla.git) requires [SortBags](https://github.com/refaim/SortBags.git) and will need to configure which direction to sort to (Left or Right).
  - It also needs to configure the sorting button and may take some tinkering when setting up.
* [MinimapButtonFrame](https://github.com/laytya/MinimapButtonFrame-vanilla.git) requires [TurtleSnacks](https://github.com/McPewPew/TurtleSnacks.git) to collect TurtleWoW's customized buttons.
  - It also adds a `no new mail` button to keep the frame from resizing.
  - This is useful if you want the frame to function as a locked toolbar.
* [pfQuest](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest.git) requires [pfQuest-turtle](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest-turtle.git)
  - This AddOn is essential when leveling and doing quests.
  - It is highly recommended for new players.
  - Contrary to [Atlas](https://github.com/Nonameby/Atlas.git), [AtlasLoot](https://github.com/Lexiebean/AtlasLoot.git) and [AtlasQuest](https://github.com/Nonameby/AtlasQuest.git), it is recommended to disable [pfQuest](https://github.com/shagu/pfQuest.git) at higher levels.
  - This is by far the biggest AddOn in this collection.
